# CAR-RENTAL-SYSTEM--C-programming-Language
A console-based Car Rental Management System in C with booking, billing and receipt generation features.
🚗 Car Rental Management System (C Language Project)
📌 Project Overview

The Car Rental Management System is a console-based application developed in C programming language to automate basic car rental operations.
This system allows users to check available cars, rent vehicles, return rented cars, and maintain simple rental records efficiently.

The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as structures, file handling, functions, and menu-driven program design, making it suitable as an academic or beginner-level project.
